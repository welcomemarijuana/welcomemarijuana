It looks like you've provided a series of commands commonly used when setting up a new Git repository and pushing it to a remote repository on GitHub. Let me break down what each command does:

echo "# welcomemarijuana" >> README.md: This command adds a heading (# welcomemarijuana) to a file named README.md. This file is often used to provide information and documentation about your project.

git init: Initializes a new Git repository in your local project directory.

git add README.md: Adds the README.md file to the staging area, preparing it for the next commit.

git commit -m "first commit": Commits the changes you've staged, along with a commit message describing the changes. In this case, it's the "first commit."

git branch -M main: Renames the default branch from "master" to "main." This is a common practice in response to the move away from using terms like "master" in version control systems.

git remote add origin https://github.com/welcomemarijuana/welcomemarijuana.git: Sets up a remote named "origin" pointing to the specified GitHub repository URL.

git push -u origin main: Pushes your committed changes to the "main" branch of the remote repository on GitHub. The -u flag is used to set up tracking, so future pushes and pulls can be done without specifying the remote and branch.
